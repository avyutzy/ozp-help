<h1>Create a Dashboard</h1>

<p>
	A dashboard is a screen where you organize your tools. It is your workspace to configure listings and allow them to share information that is only saved in the browser, not returned to each listing's respective servers.

<b>Dashboard Example</b>

<br /><br/>
<h2>Create a Dashboard</h2>

<p>You can create multiple dashboards with different configurations of listings. Consider making different dashboards for different tasks. You can use the same listing on multiple dashboards. The dashboards can be in grid or desktop format. If you edit the dashboard to change it from one format to the other, your listings will lose their state (i.e. they will refresh and you will lose the data they are displaying).</p>

<p>Create a dashboard and add a listing to it:</p>
<br />

<ol>
	<li>Click the <img alt="Dashboard access icon" src="Doc_images/dashboard-access-icon.png"  title="Dashboard access icon" /> at the bottom-left side of Webtop's lower toolbar.
		<br />
		<i>Note: Your first dashboard is called Default. If you change that name or use a different dashboard, you will see a different name to the left of the arrow.</i>
	</li>
	<li>Click <b>+Create a new dashboard</b>.</li>
	<li>Type a Name and select if the dashboard will have a grid or desktop format.</li>
	<li>Click <b>Create Dashboard</b>, the dashboard will automatically open.</li>
	<li>Now it's time to add listings. Click the <img alt="Add listings button" src="Doc_images/+.png"  title="Add listings button" /> at the bottom-left side of the Webtop's lower toolbar.</li>
	<li>All the Webtop-enabled listings will appear. Select the ones you want to use on this dashboard and click <b>Open.</b></li>
</ol>
